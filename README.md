Here are more detailed instructions. Please follow them if you need to.

1. Please log into your account on [github.com](github.com)
2. Go to the [assignment template page](https://github.com/BL-MSCH-C220-F19/01-Introduction) on GitHub
3. You will see the button in the right corner saying "Fork". Please click that.
4. A modal window will appear. It will ask you where you want to fork the repository. Please choose your account. It will create a copy of this repository in your account that you can start editing.
5. Please go to your GitHub home page and select the new 01-Introduction repository.
6. On the page, you will see a green button saying "Clone with HTTPS". Click the button. Inside the dropdown, you should be able to see a box containing an URL. You will also see an icon that looks like a clipboard with an arrow. Please click the icon that looks like a clipboard with an arrow.
7. Please open VS code. When it opens, push the F1 key. When the box opens, type "Git: Clone". Press the enter key. Then the box will open. When it opens, paste the URL you copied from GitHub. Locate the repository. On windows, the default will say something like c:\Users\(username)\Documents\01-Introduction. VS Code will download a copy of the code to your computer. 
8. You will receive an opportunity of entering your username and password. If a dialogue shows up and asks if you want VS Code to check for changes periodically, you can choose "No".
9. Once VS Code has downloaded the code, it will be in charge of keeping the code on your computer synchronized with the repository in your GitHub account. A list of the downloaded files will be on the left side of the current window.

10. First of all, you need to edit the file called LICENSE. Please change [year] into the current year and [fullname] into your full name. (2019 Huiyong Lim). Save the file.
11. Next, you have to edit the file called main.py. This python code is for this assignment. Change the line "print('Hello, Class!')" into the answer of the first question. ('Hello, my name is Huiyong Lim')")
12. Please add the extra lines to answer the remaining questions from the list above. Please be creative and escriptive. Also remember that this information will be publically available. After finishing your work, please save the file.
13. Remember to test your code. Right click on the code and select "Run Python File in Terminal". You will be able to see the results at the bottom. If the results do not look like you expected, please correct them.
14. After checking your results, open the README.md file, a file cotaining all this information. The purpose of this file is to describe what your code does. Therefore, edit it to describe what did you try to accomplish with your code. Write it in your own words and try to help anyone who will be working on this project. What are you trying to do? When other people run your code, what should they see? When you are done editing README.md, please save the file.

15. After editing the files, you should be able to see an icon on your left side that looks like three circles, connected by lines. Click the icon. 
16. At the top of the leftmost area, you should be able to see a box labeled "Message". Add a message describing what you have done. These messages are usually stated in the active-present tense. For example, "Updates the LICENSE, README.md, and completes the assignment." After typing the message, click the check mark above the text box to commit the changes.
17. You will see "Push" in the drop down to the right of the check mark. Please choose "Push". 
18. Go to GitHub and check out your page. You should be able to see the changes you made. If needed, please repeat steps 10 to 17.
19. When you believe you have done enough, turn in a URL to repository on Canvas.
